# Tribe Hack -- ManTech CTF challenge (3/4 challenges)


This is the first CTF that I attend to, it was really fun! I was able to solve 3/4 challenges over 30 hours. Learned and struggled a lot with assembly, IDA, ncat and python socket module!


Great shout out to Carl Petty form ManTech for guiding me through this event! (really nice and knowledgable guy!)
